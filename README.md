# Assignment_Sorting_Filtering_and-Handling-Missing-Data

In this assignment, I performed various operations on a Pandas DataFrame to demonstrate key data manipulation tasks, including sorting, filtering, and handling missing values. Below are the specific tasks covered:

1. Sorting the DataFrame by different columns in both ascending and descending orders.
2. Filtering the DataFrame based on specific conditions such as age and department.
3. Using the .where() and .filter() methods to create new DataFrames based on conditions.
4. Conducting basic statistical calculations like finding the mean and maximum values.
5. Handling missing data by either dropping rows with NaN values or filling them with computed values.
6. Combining DataFrames and inserting/deleting rows and columns as needed.

These tasks illustrate essential skills for data analysis using Python and Pandas, which are crucial for effective data manipulation and insights extraction.
